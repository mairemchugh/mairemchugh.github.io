    <p>Hi I'm Maire McHugh,she/her/hers. I'm a junior from Denver, Colorado.
      I am looking forward to learning more about how HTML, CSS, and Java.
      Mostly about how they all work together to create a cohesive site.
      I enjoy cooking, hiking, art, and hanging out with friends and family! </p>

    <p>This semester, I joined the club tennis team which has been really fun!
      I also have been working tirelessly on an advertising creative case study
      for a program called Young Ones. My team chose the DoorDash brief and I am
     happy to be almost done with it! The final product will be really rewarding.</p>

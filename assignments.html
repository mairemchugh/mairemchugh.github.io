  <h2>Over the course of the semester so far, we were given various tasks.
    Starting with HTML, assignment 1 was the most simple. Assignment 2 was
    actually to set up this page, and to continue editing it with the new
    information we learned. Assignment 3 and Assignment 4 were done in HTML.
    I'm so glad that we learned CSS because it brings our websites to life!</h2>

      <p>Hi I'm Maire McHugh,she/her/hers. I'm a junior from Denver, Colorado.
        I am looking forward to learning more about how HTML, CSS, and Java.
        Mostly about how they all work together to create a cohesive site.
        I enjoy cooking, hiking, art, and hanging out with friends and family! </p>
